# Diabetes-prediction-Machine-learning-
Developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes outcomes based on medical features such as Glucose levels, BMI, and other diagnostic measurements. The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, etc.) to evaluate theirÂ performance.
